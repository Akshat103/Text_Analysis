1. Approach to solution

a) Firstly I worked on extraction indivisually, where blogs have 2 kind of framewire thats why extraction function has to ckeck for two classes for tittle and text.
b) Then to use dictionary and stop words I built functions to get those from files to HashSet.
c) Then I worked with each varible calculation function in jupyter to test each.
d) Finally for each stored extracted txt analyse each one at a time and store output in excel. 

2. How to run the .py file to generate output

a) RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
b) RUN python analysis.py

3. Dependencies

a) All dependencies specified in requirements file.
b) MasterDictionary, StopWords and Input.xlsx files are required.
